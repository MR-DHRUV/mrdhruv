# Overview
This project provides a user-friendly way to visualize the A* pathfinding algorithm. It simulates the algorithmic exploration of search space in a grid.

One can customize the size of the grid and the number of obstacles, and choose different heuristic functions to see
how they affect the efficiency and adaptability of the A* algorithm in navigating diverse environments.
